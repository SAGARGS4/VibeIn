# VibeIn Chat App - Vercel Deployment Fix

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Push the updated code to your GitHub repository**
2. **In Vercel Dashboard:**

   - Go to your project settings
   - Set Environment Variables:
     - `NODE_ENV` = `production`
     - `MONGODB_URI` = your MongoDB connection string
     - `JWT_SECRET` = your JWT secret
     - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` = your Cloudinary cloud name
     - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` = your Cloudinary API key
     - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` = your Cloudinary API secret
     - `FRONTEND_URL` = `https://vibein-beryl.vercel.app` (your actual domain)

3. **Redeploy the application**

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Added `vercel.json` configuration file
2. ✅ Fixed CORS issues for production deployment
3. ✅ Added fallback PORT configuration
4. ✅ Fixed React Router future flag warnings
5. ✅ Added proper app export for Vercel
6. ✅ Updated build scripts

## Files Changed

- `vercel.json` (new)
- `backend/src/index.js` (CORS and export fixes)
- `frontend/src/main.jsx` (React Router warnings)
- `package.json` (build scripts)

The main issue was that Vercel didn't know how to route API requests to your backend. The 404 errors were happening because the `/api/*` routes weren't being handled properly.
